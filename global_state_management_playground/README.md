# Global State Management Playground

This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates the four aspects of global state management:

1. **Initializing the state**: How to set up the initial state of the application.
2. **Reading the state**: How to access the current state of the application.
3. **Updating the state**: How to change the state of the application in response to user input or other events.
4. **Subscribing to the state**: How to register a callback function to be called whenever the state changes.

This playground is designed to be a hands-on environment for experimenting with different global state management techniques. It is not intended to be a production-ready application.
